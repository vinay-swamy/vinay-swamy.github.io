	abstract = {The zinc finger e-box binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1) transcription factor is a master regulator of the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), and of the reverse mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET) processes. ZEB1 plays an integral role in mediating cell state transitions during cell lineage specification, wound healing and disease. EMT/MET are characterized by distinct changes in molecular and cellular phenotype that are generally context-independent. Posterior polymorphous corneal dystrophy (PPCD), associated with ZEB1 insufficiency, provides a new biological context in which to understand and evaluate the classic EMT/MET paradigm. PPCD is characterized by a cadherin-switch and transition to an epithelial-like transcriptomic and cellular phenotype, which we study in a cell-based model of PPCD generated using CRISPR-Cas9-mediated ZEB1 knockout in corneal endothelial cells (CEnCs). Transcriptomic and functional studies support the hypothesis that CEnC undergo a MET-like transition in PPCD, termed endothelial to epithelial transition (EnET), and lead to the conclusion that EnET may be considered a corollary to the classic EMT/MET paradigm.},

	abstract = {The advent of cell culture-based methods for the establishment and expansion of human corneal endothelial cells (CEnC) has provided a source of transplantable corneal endothelium, with a significant potential to challenge the one donor-one recipient paradigm. However, concerns over cell identity remain, and a comprehensive characterization of the cultured CEnC across serial passages has not been performed. To this end, we compared two established CEnC culture methods by assessing the transcriptomic changes that occur during in vitro expansion. In confluent monolayers, low mitogenic culture conditions preserved corneal endothelial cell state identity better than culture in high mitogenic conditions. Expansion by continuous passaging induced replicative cell senescence. Transcriptomic analysis of the senescent phenotype identified a cell senescence signature distinct for CEnC. We identified activation of both classic and new cell signaling pathways that may be targeted to prevent senescence, a significant barrier to realizing the potential clinical utility of in vitro expansion.},

	abstract = {{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Abstract{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}\textit{De novo} transcriptome construction from short-read RNA-seq is a common method for reconstructing previously annotated and novel mRNA transcripts within a given sample. However, this process lacks a way to be evaluated as it is difficult to obtain a ground-truth measure of transcript expression. With advances in third generation sequencing, full length transcripts of whole transcriptomes can be accurately sequenced to generate a ground-truth transcriptome— but it is significantly more expensive than short-read sequencing. We generated long-read Pacbio and short-read Illumina RNA sequencing data from an induced pluripotent stem cell-derived retinal pigmented epithelium (iPSC-RPE) cell line. We use the long-read data to identify simple but powerful metrics for assesing \textit{de novo} transcriptome construction and to optimize a short-read based \textit{de novo} transcriptome construction pipeline. We then apply this this pipeline to construct transcriptomes for 340 short-read RNA-seq samples originating from healthy adult and fetal retina, cornea, and RPE to generate the first pan-eye transcriptome annotation. We identify hundreds of novel gene isoforms and examine their significance in the context of ocular development and disease.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},
