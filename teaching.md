I currently teach the a workshop at the Foundation for Advanced Education(FAES) in the Sciences on creating high quality scientific visualizations with the R programming language (BIOF09: Visualization with R)

I also help teach another FAES workshop on Next-Generation Sequencing analysis in the cloud. The portion of the course I teach is on the analysis of RNA-seq data.
